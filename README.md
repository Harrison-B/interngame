In The Intern, you play as the titular intern where your job is to complete a variety of tasks from giving presentations, making coffee, and running errands. Your boss is also out to get you and has a penchant for breaking things around the office, which you'll be in charge of fixing. The goal is to complete as many tasks before the workday ends, hopefully scoring enough points to keep your job!
