## Theme/Pitch: 
You are an intern with a crazy boss, and have to accomplish every ridiculous task he asks you to do in the time limit or you’re fired! The only problem is the office environment changes, rooms move, doors disappear, some coworkers make life harder, and your tasks get increasingly ridiculous. The main part of the game is interacting with objects and NPCs and completing tasks/puzzles. 

## Core Gameplay:
- Players must complete mundane office intern tasks
- Tasks can come from supervisors or other co-workers
- Tasks may involve completing something at a station or bringing an item fromA to B
- Boss tries to destroy the office
